## New app ideas

1. Book App
    - Users can search up books, look at the book details, and favorite books. Users can also leave reviews for the novels they've read.
3. Event Meet-Up
    - Organizers can post their events on the app for viewers to see. Users can click on their event and view its
details.
3. Food Product Tracker
    - Users can scan their food product and the app will
gather its information, such as the expiration date. The
app will give reminders before the expiration date if the user hasn't already checked it off as finished.
4. UNC Charlotte Market
    - Students can post items they want to sell, whether it be textbooks, laptops, etc. Users can view the post and message the owner to purchase it
5. Aesthetic Seeker
    - Users will input the activity they want to do, such as having a picnic, doing a photoshoot, etc. The user will also select the aesthetic they want in this activity. From there the app will provide them with locations, clothing & decor suggestions, and more.

## Evaluation

1. Event Meet-Up
    - Description: A platform where organizers can post events (e.g., local meetups, study groups, cultural events), and users can browse, view details, and save events.
    - Category: Social
    - Mobile: Many users are on-the-go when looking for things to do, which makes a mobile medium perfect for this platform.
    - Story: Solves a relatable problem (finding things to do, organizing events). Young adults would likely respond well
    - Market: There would potentially be a large market because event meet up applies to any community, city, or school. This will be most valuable to visitors, newcomers, or clubs.
    - Habit: Could have a medium habit potential if notifications are implemented and events are uploaded regularly.
    - Scope: Will have a high complexity due to rsvp, location filtering, user authentication/tracking

2. Book App
    - Description: Users can search/browse books (filtering system included), look at the book details (separate page), and favorite books (will have separate page of favorited books). Users can also leave reviews for the novels they've read.
    - Category: Entertainment
    - Mobile: It is great for quick searches and managing reading lists on-the-go.
    - Story: It will allow for users to share their honest opinions on books they've read, and also keep note of books they would like to read.
    - Market: This will be useful to students, book lovers, and the general public. 
    - Habit: Could have a medium habit potential if people use it each time they want book recommendations. Habitual use can be encouraged with features like a checklist or reading goals.
    - Scope: Could have a medium scope, book data will be pulled from public APIs, favorites, and review systems.
